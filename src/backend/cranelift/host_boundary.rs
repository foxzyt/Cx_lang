//! JIT Runtime Host Boundary
//!
//! This module defines the execution boundary between the Cx JIT backend and the host process.
//!
//! # Process Ownership
//!
//! In JIT mode the host process is the Cx compiler/runner binary. The JIT runtime executes
//! inside the host process address space — there is no subprocess fork.
//! [`HostBoundary`] owns the Cranelift JIT module and controls when it is created and torn down.
//!
//! Startup sequence:
//!   1. IR validation must pass before `HostBoundary::execute` is called.
//!   2. `HostBoundary` creates a Cranelift `JITModule`, compiles all functions, locates `main`.
//!   3. `main` is called; its return value is captured as the exit code.
//!   4. The host process does **not** call `std::process::exit` inside the backend.
//!      Callers decide when and with what code to exit.
//!
//! Shutdown sequence:
//!   1. After `main` returns, `HostBoundary::execute` returns `Ok(JitOutcome)`.
//!   2. `HostBoundary` is dropped; Cranelift frees JIT memory on drop.
//!   3. The host process continues and acts on the returned `JitOutcome`.
//!
//! # Exit Code Extraction
//!
//! Cx `main` is lowered to a synthetic IR function with return type `I32`.
//! Its return value is the program's exit code.
//!
//! Mapping:
//!   - `main` returns 0  → [`JitExitCode::SUCCESS`] (0)
//!   - `main` returns n  → [`JitExitCode(n)`](JitExitCode) where n is the returned value
//!   - JIT codegen fails → [`JitExitCode::UNSUPPORTED_CONSTRUCT`] (127)
//!   - JIT runtime panic → [`JitExitCode::JIT_RUNTIME_FAILURE`] (126)
//!
//! Exit codes 126 and 127 are chosen because they fall outside the 0–125 range that
//! POSIX applications conventionally use, making them unambiguous JIT-level sentinels.
//!
//! # Output Capture
//!
//! JIT-compiled code writes directly to the host process stdout/stderr via C runtime
//! intrinsics (`puts`, `printf`). No in-process pipe redirection is performed.
//!
//! The differential harness captures JIT output by running the Cx compiler binary as a
//! subprocess with `--backend=cranelift <source_file>`, exactly as it does for the interpreter
//! baseline. This approach requires no in-process hooking and is consistent across both paths.
//!
//! # Runtime Failure Surfacing
//!
//! JIT-level failures surface as [`JitExecutionError`] variants, not as Rust panics.
//! `HostBoundary::execute` must catch all Cranelift errors and convert them.
//! The caller (`CraneliftBackend::execute`) translates to the `Backend` trait's `Result<(), String>`.
//!
//! # Determinism Guarantee
//!
//! The Cx JIT backend provides a minimal determinism guarantee:
//!
//! > **Same IR, same target, same input → same observable output on every run.**
//!
//! Specifically, given an identical `IrModule` on the same platform:
//! - The exit code returned by JIT-compiled `main` is identical across invocations.
//! - The execution path (sequence of basic blocks and instructions) is identical.
//! - Stack slot sizes and alignments are identical (determined entirely by the IR).
//!
//! ## Why the guarantee holds
//!
//! - `IrModule` is a plain Rust `Vec`-based data structure with no randomized ordering.
//! - `ValueId` and `BlockId` are sequential integers; allocation order is deterministic.
//! - `compile_ir_function` is a pure function of its `IrFunction` input — no process state.
//! - `HashMap` usage inside `compile_ir_function` is access-only (lookup by key), never
//!   iterated for output — hash randomization does not affect observable results.
//! - `cranelift_native::builder()` produces a deterministic ISA for a given host CPU.
//! - `JITModule::finalize_definitions()` processes functions in declaration order.
//! - `seal_all_blocks()` is called once after all instructions are emitted; the deferred
//!   strategy is deterministic for any CFG (forward-only or with loop back-edges).
//!
//! ## What is not guaranteed
//!
//! - Cross-platform binary identity (different ISAs produce different machine code bytes).
//! - Cross-version stability (Cranelift upgrades may change code generation).
//! - In-process stdout determinism (JIT writes directly to the host process stream;
//!   stdout capture is a post-scaffold feature).
//!
//! For the full specification and test coverage table see
//! `docs/backend/cx_jit_determinism.md`.
