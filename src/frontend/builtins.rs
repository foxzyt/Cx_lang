//! Single source of truth for Cx language builtins (tracker #008).
//!
//! Before this module, the set of builtin names (`print`, `println`, `printn`,
//! `read`, `input`, `assert`, `assert_eq`, `is_known`, `exit`) was hardcoded as
//! string literals in four places that had to agree by hand:
//!
//!   - `src/frontend/semantic.rs`  (signature recognition)
//!   - `src/runtime/runtime.rs`    (interpreter dispatch)
//!   - `src/ir/validate.rs`        (reserved-name gate)
//!   - `src/ir/lower.rs`           (JIT lowering dispatch)
//!
//! Drift between those four lists was the structural cause of several backend
//! disagreements. Each site now consults [`BUILTINS`] / [`lookup`] instead.
//!
//! Scope note: this registry covers *user-callable Cx builtins* only. The
//! C-ABI runtime intrinsic `cx_printn` (the lowered form of `print`/`printn`)
//! is a different concept and stays single-sourced by
//! `crate::ir::validate::runtime_intrinsic_names`.
//!
//! This is a pure-data leaf module: it depends on no `SemanticType` or IR type,
//! so all four consumers (frontend, runtime, ir) can import it without any
//! circular-dependency risk. Each call site maps the registry's small enums to
//! its own types.

/// Discriminator identifying each builtin. Call sites match on this instead of
/// comparing name strings, so the compiler catches a builtin that a site forgot
