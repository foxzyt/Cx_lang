# Cx Project Roadmap — Living Summary

Last updated: 2026-07-04

This file is a concise synthesis of the project's roadmap state. Detailed
0.1-era phase logs live at:
- Frontend: `docs/frontend/ROADMAP.md` (v5.0, frozen at the 0.1 RC — historical)
- Backend: `docs/backend/cx_backend_roadmap_v3_1.md` (v4.4, frozen at the 0.1 RC — historical)

## Shipped

**0.1** — tagged `9fc0d24`, 2026-05-22. Language surface frozen: structs,
generics v1/v2, enums, arrays, control flow, memory boundary model (str/strref/
Handle<T>), Result<T> + `?`, test runner. Cranelift JIT backend for the
supported 0.1 construct subset.

**0.2** — tagged `7340116`, 2026-06-06.

**0.3** — tagged `1654f5b`, shipped as a GitHub Release. Independently verified:
merge commit has 2 parents, tag points to the merge commit, local == remote,
release notes match the approved changelog. Landed:
- D1 core convergence + the JIT memory-safety gate (zero unsound markers)
- `if` as expression and statement, enums, the unknown/three-state-bool arc
- Static strings (D2.3: length, repeat, concatenation, content equality,
  print-time interpolation) — complete
- Scalar `Result<T>` (D2.4a/b/c): construct/print, the `?` operator, equality
  — complete for scalar payloads
- Labeled breaks (`'outer: loop { break 'outer / continue 'outer }`), both
  parse+reject and execution commits

## Post-0.3.0 — landed on `submain`, not yet in a tagged release

**Scalar Handle core (D2.5a/b/c)** — landed `3ea986d`. `Handle<T>` for scalar
`T` (`{I8, I16, I32, I64, Bool}`): construct, read, drop, all checked against
the interpreter. Generational safety and double-drop non-aliasing empirically
proven on both backends (interpreter and Cranelift JIT).

The sequence below reflects the project's current stated direction as of
2026-07-04. No prior committed roadmap file contained a 0.2+ version
sequence — this is the first time it's being formally recorded, not a
correction to an existing plan.

## Corrected Version Sequence

- **0.3.1** — Scalar Handle core (D2.5). *(Already landed on `submain` at
  `3ea986d` — this slot documents where it lands once tagged, not new work.)*
- **0.3.2** — Pattern matching (named binding `as v`, guard clauses) — shifted
  from 0.3.1.
- **0.3.3** — gene + phen design pass — shifted from 0.3.2.
- **0.3.4** — gene + phen implementation, operator overloading, generics v3
  (type bounds) — shifted from 0.3.3.
- **0.4** — Stdlib v1, Cranelift AOT / Ricey v0, LLVM AOT, bootstrapping
  begins/completes, math layer. *(Unchanged from prior sequencing.)*
- **1.0** — First stable release.
- **1.0+** — Graphics begins: Vulkan/DX12 bindings. *(Not before 1.0 — the
  0.4 math layer is graphics PREP, not graphics itself.)*
- **1.1+** — Renderer.
- **1.2+** — Physics.
- **1.3+** — Audio.
- **1.4+** — Networking / NOD Protocol.
- **2029+** — TSG playable.

## Future Design Work (unscheduled)

Audited during the 0.3 cycle. Both found to have **no interpreter reference**
(no `Value` variant, no eval site, no fixtures) — not "not yet implemented,"
genuinely undesigned. Deferred until each gets its own design pass; only then
can either be scheduled into a version.

- **NullPoint<T>** — a nullable-pointer type. The only existing spec is one
  line of roadmap intent ("maps into the unknown/known model"); the audit
  found the intended design ties it to two other JIT-deferred subsystems
  (the unknown/TBool seam, `Handle<T>`), which needs resolving before any
  implementation starts.
- **random stdlib foundation** — audited and found to be intent-only-minus:
  no interpreter reference, no roadmap line recording it as a decision, no
  "open-decision #2" tracker entry anywhere in the repo. A future design pass
  will also need to resolve the RNG-determinism question (JIT parity requires
  matching the interpreter's algorithm + seed state exactly, not just
  "produces a random number").

**Also deferred, not yet placed on any version:** non-scalar `Handle<T>`
(`Handle<str>`, `Handle<struct>`) and `Handle<Handle<T>>` — the D2.5
investigation found the semantic layer's `Handle<T>` claim is hardcoded
regardless of the real payload type, which would need real type-flow work
before a non-scalar payload could lower safely. Untested, no claim either way
on nested Handles. Needs its own scoping audit before scheduling.

## Working Notes

**2026-05-09:** 9 PRs merged to submain. CX-74 (exit-code propagation), CX-48/73 (assert lowering), CX-52 (float cmp), CX-53 (void return), CX-67 (CodeRabbit), CX-70/71 (review fixes), CX-54/55. 10 new branches (CX-56–66) expanding JIT instruction coverage. Submain 40 commits ahead of main. JIT: 243 tests, 0 parity failures.

**2026-05-05:** CX-18/19/20 merged to submain. CX-21–24 committed branch-local (Phase 11 error, Phase 12 start, Phase 13 start, host boundary). Submain 26+ commits ahead of main. Matrix 117/117 stable.

**2026-05-04:** PR #57 merged submain → main after 37 days. CX-7 through CX-17 IR lowering sprint landed on submain. Main jumped from 78 to 117 tests.
