# Cx Known Issues

This is a working log of known gaps and reference/JIT divergences found during
ongoing work, not a roadmap — see `docment/ROADMAP.md` for planned feature
sequencing. Entries are added as findings surface and updated (not deleted)
when fixed, so the history of what broke and why stays visible.

---

## 1. `f64` comparison (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) rejected by the interpreter

**Status: FIXED — commit `c5e8e22`.**

`src/runtime/ops.rs:173-208`'s comparison dispatch for `Lt`/`Gt`/`LtEq`/`GtEq`
had exactly one match arm per operator — `(Value::Num(a), Value::Num(b))`,
integers only — with no arm for `(Value::Float(a), Value::Float(b))`, falling
through to `RuntimeError::BadOperands`. Semantic analysis already accepted
float operands (`is_numeric` includes `F64`), so this was purely a
runtime-dispatch gap in the interpreter, not a semantic-analysis rejection.

**This was the reverse of the usual pattern.** Every other interpreter/JIT
divergence found this session had the JIT lagging the interpreter (JIT
missing something the interpreter already did correctly). Here the JIT was
already correct and the interpreter — normally treated as the reference
implementation — was the one that was wrong. Keep that context in mind if
anyone looks back at this entry later confused by the direction.

Fix: added the missing `(Value::Float, Value::Float)` arms, mirroring the
existing integer arms exactly. A mixed `Num`/`Float` comparison (e.g.
`5 > 3.14`) is not a separate case — semantic analysis's
`common_numeric_type`/`insert_cast_if_needed` already promotes the int
literal to `F64` via an inserted `Cast` node before it reaches the runtime,
so it flows through the same `(Float, Float)` arm.

## 2. Bare builtin call in trailing function/method-body position doesn't JIT-lower

**Status: OPEN.**

A bare `print(...)` call as a function or method body's *sole or last*
statement, with no trailing semicolon, fails to lower on the JIT:

```
unresolved semantic artifact reached lowering: function 'print'
```
Exit code 127. The interpreter handles this correctly.

**Not method-specific** — confirmed via a plain free-function reproducer
(`fnc: show(x: t32) { print(x) }`) with an identical failure and identical
error text/exit code. The original framing ("print inside a method body")
mis-attributed the cause to methods; methods just happen to be a natural
place to write this shape (a one-line `fnc: show_health() { print(p.health) }`).

**Mechanism:** the parser's `func_body` combinator
(`src/frontend/parser.rs:1207-1259`) purely-syntactically promotes the body's
last statement into `ret_expr` whenever it's a bare `ExprStmt` with no
trailing semicolon — with zero understanding of what the expression is. The
resulting `ret_expr` is lowered via the general expression path,
`lower_expr` (`src/ir/lower.rs:686-687`), not the statement path,
`lower_stmt`, which is where `print`/`println`/`printn`/`assert`/`assert_eq`
get their special-case builtin interception (documented at
`src/ir/lower.rs:94-95`). `lower_expr`'s `Call` handling
(`src/ir/lower.rs:1969-1984`) carries an explicit comment acknowledging this
exact scenario was assumed not to happen: *"assert/assert_eq, print,
println, and printn are handled at statement level and should not reach
`lower_expr` in well-formed programs."* `is_cx_builtin`
(`src/ir/lower.rs:96-104`) only recognizes builtins whose JIT status is
`GatedUnsupported` (genuinely-unimplemented ones like `read`/`input`) —
`print`'s status is `Lowered`, so it isn't caught there either, and falls
through to a raw `signature_table` miss, producing the observed
`UnresolvedSemanticArtifact`.

Only `print` was empirically tested; `println`/`printn`/`assert`/`assert_eq`
likely share the same failure by the same code path (same
`lower_stmt`-interception list) but this has not been individually
confirmed for each.

**Risk framing:** low risk of a silent false-parity-fail. This fails with
the JIT's own SKIP exit code (127), so if someone later writes a fixture
with this exact shape, `jit_parity_by_feature` will correctly bucket it as
SKIP, not a misleading PARITY_FAIL — unlike finding #1 above (which, before
the fix, would have shown as a genuine PARITY_FAIL had a fixture existed,
since the JIT succeeded while the interpreter errored).

**Relation to #3 below:** sits in the same code region (both concern a
function's trailing-expression / `ret_expr` handling) but is **not a
duplicate** — confirmed by direct mechanism/error-text comparison, not
name-similarity. This bug raises `LoweringError::UnresolvedSemanticArtifact`
at `lower.rs:686-687` (the `lower_expr` call itself failing); #3 raises
`LoweringError::InternalInvariantViolation` one step further down, at
`lower.rs:677-684`. In the specific reproducer tested here (a void function,
no `return` statement, `print(...)` as the only body statement), this bug
fires first and **preempts** #3's check from ever being reached — if this
bug were fixed, the exact same reproducer would then likely hit the
*separate* implicit-return-type gap (see the `t16`-cluster audit) rather
than #3 specifically, since #3 requires an explicit `return` statement to
also be present.

## 3. `t03`/`t160`/`t24` — explicit return + trailing expression

**Status: OPEN, deferred** (found during the `t16`-cluster scoping audit;
deferred there as open-ended, not yet sized).

A function with **both** an explicit `return` statement and a separate,
now-dead trailing expression statement after it triggers:

```
LoweringError::InternalInvariantViolation {
    detail: "function '{name}' has both explicit return terminator and trailing return expression"
}
```
at `src/ir/lower.rs:677-684`.

Affects `t03_explicit_return.cx`, `t160_direct_call_explicit_return_exit.cx`,
and (as a compound case, masking a second, separate bug — the `t16`
implicit-return-type gap) `t24_full_system_regression.cx`.

**Distinct from #2 above** — different error variant
(`InternalInvariantViolation` vs. `UnresolvedSemanticArtifact`), different
trigger (requires an explicit `return` statement present in the same
function; #2's reproducer has none) — confirmed by direct comparison of
error text and mechanism, not by name-similarity.

Not yet sized. The `t16`-cluster audit found the related implicit-return-type
gap touches broad, shared function-signature infrastructure with unclear
full extent, and recommended deferring the whole cluster rather than
attempting a quick cleanup. This entry (`t03`/`t160`/`t24` specifically) was
not separately re-scoped beyond that.

---

## 4. `print(enum)` diverges between interpreter and JIT

**Status: OPEN — sized, not attempted.** Confirmed real sizing, not a
dispatch-arm fix.

Printing a bare enum-typed value produces different output on each backend:

- Interpreter: the variant name, e.g. `Color::Green`
  (`src/runtime/runtime.rs:152`: `Value::EnumVariant(e, v) => format!("{}::{}", e, v)`).
- JIT: the raw tag value, e.g. `1` — because `SemanticType::Enum(_)` erases
  to the tag's IR type, `IrType::I8`, at lowering
  (`src/ir/lower.rs:4563`), and printing an `I8` just prints the integer
  (`route_print_arg`, see #5 below for its full dispatch).

Found incidentally while designing the pattern-matching `as v`-binding
discriminating-canary fixture: `print(v)` on an enum-typed binding was
briefly considered as the test's payload, then dropped in favor of a
nested-`when`-based canary specifically to avoid this exact divergence
contaminating an unrelated feature's regression test.

No existing fixture in the verification matrix exercises `print` on a bare
enum value in a way that's checked for interp/JIT parity, so this gap has
not yet surfaced as a `PARITY_FAIL` in `jit_parity_by_feature` — but would,
if one were added.

**Real sizing, confirmed by reading the lowering path before attempting
anything:** `EnumDef` lowering (`src/ir/lower.rs:511,1100`) emits **zero
IR** — no static data, no table, nothing. There is no tag→name lookup
structure anywhere in the JIT pipeline; by the time a value reaches
`route_print_arg` it's already erased to a bare `IrType::I8`, structurally
indistinguishable from a plain `t8`, with no way to know it came from an
enum at all, let alone which enum or what its variant names are. Fixing
this is not a dispatch-arm addition — it requires designing and building
new static infrastructure: a per-enum tag→name string table, emitted at
`EnumDef`-lowering time (from the semantic layer's `EnumId`/variant-name
info, which does still exist at that point), referenced at the print call
site via a new lookup mechanism. This is real design work, not a quick fix.

This is now the **more-precisely-understood** of the two "not attempted"
fixes from tonight's pass (see #5) — sized correctly and deliberately not
attempted, rather than attempted and found broken. It remains the more
dangerous of the two bugs in this file: a silent divergence with matching
exit codes on both sides, not a clean refusal.

## 5. Bare `I128` printing not lowered on JIT

**Status: OPEN — attempted, built cleanly, JIT reproducer segfaulted.** The
previous "fully scoped, low risk, ready to build" framing in this entry was
wrong — removed below.

`route_print_arg` (`src/ir/lower.rs:4646-4667`) dispatches on the print
argument's `IrType`: `I64` direct, `I8`/`I16`/`I32` via a widening `Cast`,
`Bool`/`TBool` via `cx_print_bool` — and a catch-all `_ => Ok(None)` that
rejects everything else uniformly (`F64`, `I128`, `Ptr`, `Str`, composites).
`I128` is a **plain omission**, not a deliberate architectural exclusion —
nothing else in the surrounding code treats `I128` specially or defers it on
purpose.

Affects any bare `i128`-typed print, including reading a `Handle<T>`'s value
when `T` is `t128`.

**What was actually tried:** a new `IrType::I128` arm in `route_print_arg`,
a new `cx_print_i128(n: i128)` host callback mirroring `cx_printn`'s exact
shape (`extern "C" fn` + JIT symbol registration + Cranelift signature
declaration), plus the matching IR-validator registration. Built with zero
compile errors. The JIT reproducer (`x: t128 = 42; print(x)`) then
**segfaulted (exit 139)** — not value-dependent: reproduced identically with
a trivial value and with `i128::MAX`. Reverted in full
(`git checkout --` on all three touched files); confirmed the working tree
returned to a clean diff and the original behavior (a structured
`UnsupportedSemanticConstruct` error, exit 127 — not a crash) still holds at
HEAD.

**Root cause (diagnosed, not fixed):** passing a raw `i128` by value into a
Rust `extern "C"` host callback from Cranelift-JIT-compiled code is a
boundary this codebase has never actually exercised before, despite
appearances. `Result<T>`'s `i128` (D2.4a) is returned *from* Cranelift code
via the packed representation — it never crosses into a Rust host function
as an `i128` argument. Every existing Handle callback (`cx_handle_new`,
`cx_handle_val`, `cx_handle_drop`) passes `i64`. So this fix was the first
real attempt to pass a native Cranelift `I128` value as an argument to an
`extern "C" fn(i128)`, and it doesn't work. The existing
`enable_llvm_abi_extensions` flag (already enabled, `host_boundary.rs:566`)
is documented as covering the packed-i128 `Result<T>` rep for *internal*
Cranelift-to-Cranelift value passing — a different boundary from calling
into an external Rust host symbol. Most likely explanation: a Windows x64
calling-convention mismatch — the Microsoft x64 ABI conventionally passes
wide (>8-byte) scalars by reference, not in a register pair, and Cranelift's
native `I128` type may not marshal to that convention when emitting a call
to an external symbol.

**Suggested fix direction for whoever picks this up next — untested, a
direction, not a solution:** pass the `i128` by pointer instead of by value,
mirroring how `str` descriptors already cross this exact host-boundary
successfully today (`cx_print_str`, `src/backend/cranelift/host_boundary.rs:301-310`,
a leaked `&'static` descriptor passed as an address). This would need the
JIT to spill the `I128` SSA value to a stack slot and pass its address, then
have the callback dereference it — a materially different (and larger)
shape than "one new match arm plus one host callback." Not attempted; needs
its own sizing pass before a second attempt.
