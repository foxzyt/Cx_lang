# CX JIT Parity Checklist — Phase 12

**Ticket:** CX-69  
**Roadmap:** Phase 12, Differential Backend Harness — "Per-feature parity checklist"

This document records the per-feature JIT parity classification scheme, the
current baseline from a real run, and the gate semantics used by the
`jit_parity_by_feature` test.

---

## 1. Feature Classification Scheme

Every fixture in `src/tests/verification_matrix/` maps to exactly one
`FeatureCategory` variant. The mapping is defined by `feature_of()` in
`src/diff_harness.rs`. The 16 categories cover the full 0.1 supported construct
set:

| Category       | Description                                  | Key fixtures |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Arithmetic     | Integer arithmetic, overflow, eval order     | t01, t89–t95, t103, t114_eval_order_binary_arith, t115_eval_order_compare, t116–t121; exit-code: t172_arith_t128_exit (CX-228) |
| VariableDecl   | Variable/const declarations, scope, type errors | t15, t56, t57, t101, t102, t122–t124; exit-code SKIP: t173_const_decl_exit, t174_block_scope_shadow_exit (CX-228) |
| IfElse         | Conditional branches                         | t44, t45, t46 (output-verified); t129, t130, t131 (exit-code-verified, CX-102/CX-111) |
| WhileLoop      | While loops and while-in construct           | t23, t34, t35, t105, t107, t108 (output-verified); t132, t133 (exit-code-verified, CX-102) |
| ForLoop        | For-in loops                                 | t48, t104 (output-verified); t149, t150 (exit-code-verified, CX-124) |
| InfiniteLoop   | `loop { ... break }` (infinite loop + break) | t25, t106, t134; exit-code: t167_infinite_loop_counter_exit, t168_infinite_loop_countdown_exit (CX-228) |
| DirectCall     | Function definitions, calls, return semantics| t02–t08, t14, t29, t50, t113; exit-code: t159–t163 (PASS), t164_direct_call_recursive_exit (SKIP) (CX-228) |
| Struct         | Struct definitions, impl blocks, field access| t36, t39, t40, t43, t109, t110, t114_field_type_mismatch_reject, t115_strref_in_struct_reject, t125–t127; MethodCall SKIP: t175_impl_basic_exit, t176_impl_return_exit, t177_multi_alias_impl_exit (CX-228) |
| Array          | Array literals and array-of-result           | t33, t112 (output-verified); t146_array_read_exit, t147_array_write_exit, t148_array_in_func_exit (exit-code-verified, CX-121) |
| CompoundAssign | Compound assignment operators (+=, etc.)     | t26, t41, t128, t151, t152, t153 (mixed output/exit-code fixtures; CX-119, CX-187); exit-code: t169_compound_assign_func_exit (CX-228) |
| Unary          | Unary operators (negation, etc.)             | t96; exit-code: t165_unary_neg_int_exit, t166_unary_not_bool_exit (CX-228) |
| Cast           | Explicit type casts                          | t139, t140, t157, t158 |
| FloatOps       | f64 operations                               | t55, t135–t138, t155–t156 |
| BuiltinAssert  | `assert` and `assert_eq` builtins            | t77–t80; exit-code pass-condition: t170_assert_pass_exit, t171_assert_eq_pass_exit (CX-228) |
| LogicalOps     | Logical AND/OR short-circuit operators       | t141, t142 |
| Other          | Enums, generics, when-blocks, handles, macros, imports, Result/try, string interp, semicolons, copy semantics, and any fixture not matching a named category | t09–t22, t24, t27–t32, t37–t38, t42, t47, t49, t51–t54, t58–t76, t81–t88, t97–t100, t111; exit-code-verified: t143–t145 (CX-113); integration: t154_integration_multifn (CX-182) |

Fixtures not explicitly listed in `feature_of()` fall into `Other`.

## 2. PASS / SKIP / PARITY_FAIL Semantics

Each fixture is run through `Cx_0V --backend=cranelift <fixture>` as a
subprocess. The outcome is classified as follows:

### SKIP

A fixture is SKIP when the JIT backend could not compile or execute it due to
an unsupported construct. Two signals indicate SKIP:

1. **Exit code 127** (`JitExitCode::UNSUPPORTED_CONSTRUCT`): the binary
   propagated the unsupported-construct sentinel to the process exit code.
   This is the forward-compatible path once the binary is updated to call
   `std::process::exit(127)` on JIT codegen failure.

2. **Exit code 0 with non-empty stderr**: the IR lowering or JIT codegen step
   failed, printed an error message to stderr, and returned without running the
   Cx program. The process exits 0 because `CraneliftBackend::execute` returns
   `Err(msg)` which is logged via `eprintln!` in `main.rs` without setting an
   exit code. A non-empty stderr distinguishes this from a successful JIT run
   that produced no stdout output. Expected-fail (semantic-error) fixtures take
   a different path — they fail before reaching the JIT and exit non-zero via
   `std::process::exit(1)` — so they are not mistakenly classified as SKIP.

SKIP is not a failure. It records that the JIT has not yet gained coverage for
that construct and is expected during early Phase 12–14 development.

### PASS

A fixture is PASS when the JIT outcome matches the stored expectation:

- **Expected-fail** fixture: the subprocess exits non-zero (semantic analysis
  rejected the program, as expected). Both interpreter and JIT reject it.
- **Pass-any** fixture: the subprocess exits 0 with empty stderr (the JIT ran
  the program and it returned 0).
- **Pass-with-output** fixture: the subprocess exits 0 with empty stderr and
  stdout (after CRLF normalisation and trailing-whitespace trim) matches the
  stored `.expected_output` content.

### PARITY_FAIL

A fixture is PARITY_FAIL when the JIT outcome diverges from the stored
expectation and neither SKIP signal is set:

- Expected-fail fixture that the JIT accepted (exit 0, empty stderr)
- Pass-any fixture that the JIT rejected (exit non-zero, empty stderr)
- Pass-with-output fixture where stdout does not match (either wrong output or
  JIT crashed after having already written partial output to stdout)

A non-zero PARITY_FAIL count in any category causes `jit_parity_by_feature`
to fail. PARITY_FAIL represents a real divergence between the JIT and the
expected program behavior and must be investigated and fixed.

## 3. Current Per-Feature Baseline

Captured from:

```bash
cargo build --features jit && cargo test --features jit jit_parity_by_feature -- --nocapture
```

Run on submain as of 2026-05-21 (commit 2e4f0c6 + the polish-pass commit). Earlier baseline: `train/backend-determinism` (CX-230 merge window, 2026-05-17).
Includes exit-code-verified fixtures added in CX-102 (t129–t134), CX-105/CX-107 LogicalOps
fixtures (t141–t142), the CX-111 bool-variable negation extension to t131,
CX-113 when-block exit-code fixtures (t143–t145), CX-119 var compound assign
exit-code fixture (t151_var_compound_assign_exit), CX-121 Array exit-code fixtures
(t146_array_read_exit, t147_array_write_exit, t148_array_in_func_exit),
CX-124 ForLoop exit-code fixtures (t149–t150), CX-121 ArrayAlloca JIT emit
(IrInst::ArrayAlloca Cranelift lowering), CX-136 print/println intrinsic
dispatch to cx_printn, CX-187 CompoundAssign DotAccess and Index exit-code
fixtures (t152_compound_assign_dotaccess_exit, t153_compound_assign_index_exit)
plus parser support for `arr:[i] op= value` compound assign on array elements,
CX-182 integration multi-function PassWithOutput fixture
(t154_integration_multifn) rebased onto submain via CX-196,
CX-117/CX-209 FloatOps/Cast parity fixtures (t155_float_arith_mod_exit,
t156_float_neg_exit, t157_cast_neg_t32_to_f64_exit, t158_cast_t64_to_f64_exit)
rebased onto submain via CX-217, CX-152/CX-218 Numeric/Unknown type fallbacks
in IR lowering (VarRef, Assign, CompoundAssign, and arithmetic binary expressions
now resolve placeholder types to the stored binding or target-native integer width),
and CX-228 parity fixture backlog audit adding 19 fixtures (t159–t177): DirectCall
exit-code (t159–t164), Unary exit-code (t165–t166), InfiniteLoop additional
(t167–t168), CompoundAssign in-func (t169), BuiltinAssert pass-condition
(t170–t171), Arithmetic t128 (t172), VariableDecl const/block-scope (t173–t174),

Total: 182 fixtures, 120 PASS / 62 SKIP / 0 PARITY_FAILs
```

### Interpretation

**PASS fixtures** are those where parity is confirmed today:

- **Expected-fail fixtures** in any category exit non-zero (semantic error),
  matching the expectation. Both interpreter and JIT correctly reject them.
- **Exit-code-verified fixtures** use `assert_eq` instead of `print`, so
  their correctness is verified by exit code 0.
- **Output-verified fixtures** whose `print` calls were previously SKIP are
  now PASS following CX-136 print/println dispatch to `cx_printn` for i64
  arguments.
- A small number of **pass-any fixtures** where the JIT happened to compile
  and execute successfully (no stderr error, exit 0) also appear as PASS.

**SKIP fixtures** are those where IR lowering or JIT codegen has not yet been
implemented for the construct used. After the 0.1 polish pass (when-block
Option A, method-call lowering, Cast + F64 binary arithmetic, narrow-int and
Bool print intrinsics), the remaining gaps are: enums and `EnumVariant` arms
in `when`, generics and `TypeParam`, `Handle<T>`, `Str`/`StrRef` and string
interpolation, `Result<T>`/`?` propagation, `WhileIn` source-to-IR, full TBool
unknown propagation through arithmetic/logical ops, and `t128`/`f64` print
formatting. As subsequent phases land, SKIP counts will continue to decrease
and PASS counts will increase.

**PARITY_FAIL = 0** across all 16 categories. The gate holds.

**IfElse parity coverage (CX-102/CX-111/CX-136):** t129 mirrors t44 (basic if/else),
t130 mirrors t45 (if/else in function), t131 mirrors t46 (negated conditions,
including bool-variable negation added in CX-111). The 4 PASS reflect the
3 exit-code-verified fixtures plus one print-based original now passing via
CX-136 print dispatch; the 2 SKIP are the remaining print-based originals.

**WhileLoop parity coverage (CX-102/CX-136/CX-152):** t132 covers basic while loops and
top-level while at file scope; t133 covers while in a function. The 6 PASS
reflect the 2 exit-code-verified fixtures (t132, t133) plus 4 print-based originals
(t23, t105, t107, t108) now passing via CX-136 print dispatch and CX-152 Numeric
type fallback in Assign/VarRef lowering; the 2 SKIP are t34 (while-in range-based)
and t35 (while-in-then), which use the `while in arr:...` construct not yet
lowerable from source through the full IR pipeline.

**WhenBlock parity coverage (CX-113):** t143 mirrors t19 (numeric pattern), t144
mirrors t20 (TBool three-way), t145 mirrors t21 (range pattern). All 3 are SKIP
in JIT (when-block lowering not yet implemented; exits 127). Once when-block
lowering lands, these fixtures will transition from SKIP to PASS without changes.

**CompoundAssign parity (CX-119/CX-187/CX-152/CX-228):** t151 tests all five compound-assign
operators (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=) on a typed t64 plain variable, verified by exit
code (CX-119). t152 tests all five operators on a struct field (DotAccess target),
extending t128 which only covered `-=`. t153 tests all five operators on an array
element (Index target), enabled by CX-187 parser support for `arr:[i] op= value`
(added `AssignTarget::Index` to the AST and a new `index_compound_assign` parser
rule). t26 (`let i; i = 0; while (i < 6) { print(i); i += 2 }`) uses a
let-bound plain variable with an unresolved Numeric type: CX-152's Assign and
CompoundAssign Numeric fallbacks enable `i = 0` and `i += 2` to lower correctly
to I64 instead of returning UnsupportedSemanticType. t169_compound_assign_func_exit
(CX-228) tests +=, -=, *= on function-local typed t64 variables — PASS because
CX-152's Numeric fallback resolves the type correctly in function-local scope.
The 6 PASS reflect t26, t128, t151, t152, t153, and t169; the 1 SKIP is
t41 (print-based struct compound assign that remains SKIP).

**ForLoop parity coverage (CX-124/CX-136):** t149 mirrors t48 (top-level for loop at file scope),
covering exclusive range (`0..5`), empty range (`3..3`, 0 iterations), and inclusive range
(`1..=4`). t150 mirrors t104 (for loop inside a function), covering a sum-accumulator pattern
with a mutable variable carried through the loop. The 4 PASS cover all four ForLoop fixtures:
t149 and t150 (exit-code-verified) plus t48 and t104 (print-based originals now passing via
CX-136 print dispatch). ForLoop has 0 SKIP — full parity coverage across this category.

**Array parity coverage (CX-121):** t146_array_read_exit, t147_array_write_exit, and
t148_array_in_func_exit are exit-code-verified fixtures that exercise stack array allocation,
element read/write, and array passing through function calls. The 3 PASS reflect these three
fixtures passing via the CX-121 ArrayAlloca JIT emit (`IrInst::ArrayAlloca` lowered to
Cranelift via `compute_array_layout`). The 2 SKIP are t33 and t112 (print-based originals
that remain SKIP).

**FloatOps/Cast parity fixtures (CX-117/CX-209, rebased CX-217):** t155_float_arith_mod_exit
exercises f64 modulo, scaling the remainder by 10.0 and casting to t32 to avoid rounding drift.
t156_float_neg_exit exercises unary f64 negation (lowered in IR as `ConstFloat(0.0) + Binary(Sub,
F64)`), casting the result to t32. t157_cast_neg_t32_to_f64_exit exercises negative t32→f64
widening, verifying sign preservation through the round-trip t32→f64→t32. t158_cast_t64_to_f64_exit
exercises t64→f64 widening (the `fcvt` path for 64-bit integers), including negative values.
All four are SKIP (float ops and cast constructs not yet JIT-lowerable; exits 127). Cast SKIP count
rises from 2 to 4; FloatOps SKIP count rises from 5 to 7; total fixture count rises from 158 to 162.

**Integration fixture (CX-182, rebased CX-196):** t154_integration_multifn is a
PassWithOutput fixture exercising two user-defined functions (`sum_up_to` using a while loop,
`abs_diff` using an if/else), arithmetic operations, and three `print` calls verified against
`.expected_output`. It crosses DirectCall + WhileLoop + IfElse + Arithmetic category
boundaries and falls into `Other` via the wildcard. The fixture is PASS via CX-136 print
dispatch; its original number (t152) was taken by the CX-187 CompoundAssign DotAccess exit
fixture so it was renumbered to t154 during the CX-196 rebase.

**CX-228 parity backlog audit (t159–t177):** 19 fixtures ported from the canceled
parity backlog (CX-114 through CX-163, CX-186). All fixture numbers were renumbered
to follow the current t158 high-water mark.

- **DirectCall (t159–t164, CX-228):** Six exit-code-verified DirectCall fixtures mirroring
  t02, t03, t14, t29, t50, t113 without print: implicit return, explicit return, zero-arg,
  chained calls, forward declaration, and recursive fib. t159–t163 PASS immediately.
  t164_direct_call_recursive_exit SKIP (recursive function IR lowering exits 127). DirectCall
  PASS rises from 7 to 12, SKIP from 4 to 5.

- **Unary (t165–t166, CX-228):** Two exit-code-verified Unary fixtures: t165_unary_neg_int_exit
  (integer negation, lowered as `0 - x` binary sub) and t166_unary_not_bool_exit (boolean NOT,
  lowered as `x == 0` compare). Both PASS immediately. Unary PASS rises from 0 to 2.

- **InfiniteLoop (t167–t168, CX-228):** Two additional InfiniteLoop fixtures: t167_infinite_loop_counter_exit
  (file-scope accumulator loop) and t168_infinite_loop_countdown_exit (countdown function using
  loop + break). Both PASS. InfiniteLoop PASS rises from 2 to 4.

- **CompoundAssign (t169, CX-228):** t169_compound_assign_func_exit tests +=, -=, *= on
  function-local t64 variables. PASS via CX-152 Numeric type fallback.

- **BuiltinAssert (t170–t171, CX-228):** t170_assert_pass_exit (assert() with always-true
  conditions) and t171_assert_eq_pass_exit (assert_eq() with equal values). Both PASS
  immediately since the Trap path is never triggered at runtime. BuiltinAssert PASS rises
  from 2 to 4.

- **Arithmetic (t172, CX-228):** t172_arith_t128_exit exercises t128 add/sub/mul using
  assert_eq. SKIP (t128 multi-word Cranelift lowering not yet implemented, consistent with
  t95_overflow_t128_unchanged). Arithmetic SKIP rises from 9 to 10.

- **VariableDecl (t173–t174, CX-228):** t173_const_decl_exit (three const t64 declarations)
  and t174_block_scope_shadow_exit (block-scope variable shadowing). Both SKIP (ConstDecl
  and Block are `unsupported!` in `src/ir/lower.rs`). VariableDecl SKIP rises from 3 to 5.

- **Struct/MethodCall (t175–t177, CX-228):** t175_impl_basic_exit, t176_impl_return_exit,
  t177_multi_alias_impl_exit mirror t39, t40, t43 without print using assert_eq. All SKIP
  (MethodCall/ImplBlock lowering not yet implemented). Struct SKIP rises from 5 to 8.

Total fixture count rises from 162 to 181.

---

## 4. Gate Criteria

`jit_parity_by_feature` (in `src/diff_harness.rs`) enforces:

- **Zero PARITY_FAILs** across all feature categories.
- Any non-zero PARITY_FAIL count causes the test to fail with a diagnostic
  table showing which categories diverged.

SKIP counts are informational only — they do not cause the test to fail.

Run the gate with:

```bash
cargo build --features jit && cargo test --features jit jit_parity_by_feature --nocapture
```

Or as part of the full suite:

```bash
cargo build --features jit && cargo test --features jit
```

---

## 5. Updating This Document

When new Phase 14+ work lands and JIT coverage expands:

1. Run `cargo test --features jit jit_parity_by_feature --nocapture` to
   capture the new baseline.
2. Update the table in Section 3 with the new counts.
3. Update the interpretation note to reflect which new categories have moved
   from SKIP to PASS.

When new fixtures are added to the verification matrix, update the
classification table in Section 1 and the `feature_of()` function in
`src/diff_harness.rs` to keep every fixture mapped to exactly one category.
